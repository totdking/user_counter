# A solana onchain counter
1. go to anchor.toml and change the localnet to devnet
2. run anchor build and anchor deploy on your terminal

# to run the front end
1. run npx create-solana-dapp my solana dapp(this is optional as it is already installed but you might need to install react to be able to use and view the frontend)
2. run npm start and modify the js to your content. (NOTE THIS IS STILL A PROTOTYPE AS THE CONNECT WALLET DOES NOT WORK YET)
